**BuddyBook** is a web-based application that allows users to create teams, add profiles, and invite friends to their teams via email. This platform combines the traditional slam book concept with modern features, providing a fun and easy way to connect, share, and engage with friends and team members.

This project is inspired by a previous React app that my teammate Julia and I built. This version is built with Vite, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL.
